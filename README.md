# Project-02-Lab-Text-Adventure
Project 02 will require you to implement a text adventure game using the C programming language. A text adventure game is a form of interactive fiction in which players use text commands to control characters, influence the environment, and navigate a virtual world. The first text adventure game developed between 1975-1977 was called Colossal Cave Adventure. If you have never played a text adventure game you should give it a try to get the idea. The goal of this lab is to practice various aspects of the C programming language to help you prepare for implementing a text adventure of your own.
